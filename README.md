 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer demographics like age, gender, and country, along with their spending behavior. It uses data analytics tools such as **SQL Server**, **Power BI**, and **Python (Google Colab)** to generate insights and visualize patterns.

---

 🔧 Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Microsoft Power BI
- Excel
- Python (Google Colab using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

 🚀 Project Workflow

1.Excel Cleaning: Removed nulls, standardized fields
2. SQL Server: Inserted cleaned data via custom INSERT queries
3. Power BI: Built dashboard with:
   - Pie chart – Gender distribution
   - Column chart – Country-wise customer count
   - Line chart – Spending score over time
   - Interactive slicers for Country and Gender
4.Python (Colab):
   - Age group segmentation using pandas
   - Gender-based and age-based spending analysis
   - Visualized using pie & bar charts
